Ask yourself the following questions should you believe your device is seized
<br>
Is your device lost?
<br>
Has it been stolen or seized by a third party?
<br>
In any of these incidences it is very important to get a clear picture of what happened, what kinds of data and accounts may be vulnerable as a result and what steps must be taken to prevent the leaking and misuse of your information, contacts and accounts.
<br>
Should you believe your device is seized, start by answering some simple questions:
- What happened?
- What sort of device are you missing? A computer, mobile phone, tablet or an external hard drive?
- When and where did you lose the device?
- How did you lose the device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority or did you simply lose track of it?
-Is the device still missing?

<br>
Think about the kinds of security protections the device had in place:
- Was the device protected by a password or other security measures?
- Which operating system was running on the device? Was this a legal version, or was it an illegal, jailbroken or rooted version?
- Does the device have full disk encryption turned on?
- What state was your device in when it was lost? Were you logged in? Was the device on but password-locked? Was it sleeping or hibernating? Completely turned off?
- Do you have remote access to the device?

<br>
Think about the content of what you had on the device. Make an inventory of the different types of sensitive information that was on your device. Examples include email, chat history, social media, contacts (email, Skype, chat, etc.), files, location data, credit card data and more.
<br>
What sort of base software was it using, i.e. Windows, OS X, Android, iPhone?
<br>
Did you use encryption tools for email or chat (such as PGP and OTR)?
<br>
What accounts does this device have access to? This can be email, social media, chat, IM and banking accounts that the device can access, browsers that have saved passwords to account, cookies that show your internet browsing history, authentication tokens such as fingerprint on iPhone 5 and accounts that use the device for secondary authentication.
<br>
Do your accounts have saved passwords and/or automatically log in? This is common for email, Skype and other chat programs, or if you save your passwords in your web browser instead of a password manager like KeePass.
<br>
After answering these questions, take the following steps to mitigate the problem:
<br>

<!--Perhaps there's a way here to have users select the situation that applies to them, rather than making users have to go through lots of information that doesn't concern them. This would improve flow. One idea here would be, "Is your device still missing? Do you have your device back?"-->

If your device is still missing take the following four steps:
- Step 1: When your device has access to accounts (email, social media or web account) remove the authorization for this device for all accounts. This can be done by going to your accounts online and changing the account permissions.
- Step 2: Change the passwords for all accounts that are accessible by this device. To learn more about doing this, refer to the Account Hijacked section.
- Step 3: Turn on 2-factor authentication for all accounts that were accessible by this device. Please note that not all accounts support 2-factor authentication.
- Step 4: If you have a tool installed on your lost devices that allows you to erase the data and the history of your device, use it.

<br>
If you get your device back, take the following steps:
-Be careful as you do not know who has had access to your device.
- Depending on the level of risk youâ€™re facing, you may want to treat the device as if it is now untrusted or compromised. Ask yourself the following questions and assess the risk that your device has been compromised:
- How long was the device out of your sight?
- Who potentially could have had access to it?
- Why would they want access to it?
- Are there signs that the device has been physically tampered with?

<br>
If you have lost contact with your device for an extended period of time and you feel there is a chance that something has been installed on it, please consider the following:
- Computer: reinstall the OS from scratch and recover all documents from the last backup and scan all your documents and files with antivirus software. For more guidance on this, see cleaning up your device in the malware section.
- Phones and tablets: Depending on your level of risk and the circumstances under which your mobile phone or tablet was taken, it may be advisable to not use it again. If possible, migrate all of the data off of your phone or tables and purchase a new one.
- If you cannot change devices but you suspect it might be compromised, take precautions and do not use your phone or tablet for sensitive communication or opening sensitive files. Do not take it with you when going to sensitive meetings or have it with you when discussing sensitive topics.
