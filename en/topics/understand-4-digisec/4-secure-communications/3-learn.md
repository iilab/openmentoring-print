Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. When communicating there are different levels of security. This section focuses on protecting the content of your communications.
&lt;br&gt;
Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation, your threat model and the activities in which you are involved.
&lt;br&gt;
If you are actively surveilled, for instance, you need to focus on many more aspects regarding your safety and the safety of the people you communicate with.
&lt;br&gt;
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption (such a PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Textsecure on your phone) is better than using a tool with transport-layer encryption (such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter).
&lt;br&gt;
Anonymisation is another coponent of secure communications. Anonymisation tools hide the sender and recipient of a message and will protect the identity of the participants in a communication.
&lt;br&gt;
##If your communications are comproposed
Depending on how advanced your digital security and operational security practices are, you might need to consider that your communications are compromised.
&lt;br&gt;
In this case you have to consider the consequence for yourself and your contact to reveal information about the emergency.
&lt;br&gt;
Stop using the communications services/accounts that you believe are compromised immediately. Create a new account and remember not to re-use your existing usernames, passwords or email accounts.
&lt;br&gt;
Unless your threat model includes surveillance by very well resourced governments such as the USA, the UK, China or many governments listed in Google&#39;s transparency report, using Google products may afford you a degree of protection.
&lt;br&gt;
Google tools (especially using Google tools on Chrome) can significantly increase security in these situations, and gives you access to more secure email, chat and voice/video conferencing.
&lt;br&gt;
This security only helps &#39;inside&#39; Google, i.e. Gmail to Gmail or Gchat to Gchat. It offers less protection if anyone forwards this information outside of Google, or a different email address then Gmail is added to a Gchat discussion.
&lt;br&gt;
An alternative to Google is Riseup, a volunteer group working to create democratic alternatives and practice self-determination by controlling our own secure means of communications. They offer services such as Gmal and Gchat.
&lt;br&gt;
It is important to note that Riseup does not have the resources of Google. That said, depending on your situation, Riseup may be more appropriate.
&lt;br&gt;
##Encryption tools
For end-to-end security, there are many tools with strong encryption you can use. Here are a few recommendations:
**Pidgin (PC)** and **Adium (Mac)** allow you to chat securely, with end-to-end encryption using OTR. Here is a guide to installing Pidgin with OTR.
&lt;br&gt;
**Jitsi** can be used both for text chat as well as encrypted voice and video. Use this guide to set it up. You can create an account for a secure voice/video call for free.
&lt;br&gt;
**PGP (PC and Mac)** allows you to set up end-to-end encryption for your email. Tactical Tech has developed a [detailed guide](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/thunderbird/windows) for using PGP with Thunderbird on your computer.
&lt;br&gt;
**Tor Browser Bundle** can be used to increase your security and privacy while visiting websites by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world.
