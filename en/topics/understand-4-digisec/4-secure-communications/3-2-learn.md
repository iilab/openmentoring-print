## If your communications are compromised

Depending on how advanced your digital security and operational security practices are, you might need to consider that your communications are compromised.
&lt;br&gt;
In this case you have to consider the consequence for yourself and your contact to reveal information about the emergency.
&lt;br&gt;
**Stop using the communications services/accounts that you believe are compromised immediately.** Create a new account and remember not to re-use your existing usernames, passwords or email accounts.
&lt;br&gt;
# Google products
Unless your threat model includes surveillance by very well resourced governments such as the USA, the UK, China or many governments listed in Google&#39;s transparency report, using Google products may afford you a degree of protection.
&lt;br&gt;
Google tools (especially using Google tools on Chrome) can significantly increase security in these situations, and gives you access to more secure email, chat and voice/video conferencing.
&lt;br&gt;
This security only helps &#39;inside&#39; Google, i.e. Gmail to Gmail or Gchat to Gchat. It offers less protection if anyone forwards this information outside of Google, or a different email address then Gmail is added to a Gchat discussion.
&lt;br&gt;
# Alternatives to Google
An alternative to Google is [Riseup](https://www.riseup.net/), a volunteer group working to create democratic alternatives and practice self-determination by controlling our own secure means of communications. They offer services such as Gmail and Gchat.
&lt;br&gt;
It is important to note that Riseup does not have the resources of Google. That said, depending on your situation, Riseup may be more appropriate.
