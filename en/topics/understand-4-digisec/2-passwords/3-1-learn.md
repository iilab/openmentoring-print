Passwords are important for both online security and privacy. Bad passwords can easily nullify most of your other efforts.
&lt;br&gt;
Here is some basic advice on choosing passwords: Don’t use the same password across devices. Don’t use your name or account in the password. Don’t use common passwords (e.g., “12345,” family names).
&lt;br&gt;
Strong passwords are long and include a combination of lower- and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters; their strength increases with length and complexity.

To test your password, you can play around with the “How secure is my password?” tool. This site will calculate how quickly a desktop PC could crack your password. “Hello12,” for example, would take about 19 seconds. But caution: after you enter your password into this public site, it might not be a bad idea to change it. And if you really believe that you are up against advanced adversaries, keep in mind that they’ll have much more computing power than a normal desktop PC.

If you want to be serious about passwords, you should consider getting a password manager, which is considered to be the most secure way to use complex and varying passwords and still remember them. KeePassX is an open-source password manager, and once you’ve set your master password, it creates and saves passwords for you. To enhance convenience, you can synchronize your password database – for example, by using a cloud service, so that you have access on various computers as well as your phone. That way, you’ll have ’round-the-clock access to strong passwords.

Alternative password managers include LastPass, 1Password and the recently developed, open-source Encryptr. Depending on your environment, you can also consider breaking one of the most basic rules: write it down. By this, we don’t mean, “Write it down and pin it to your computer.” But unless you believe that somebody will break into your room to filch your password, why not write it down on a sheet of paper and slip it into a random folder? If you don’t write it down, you may be wary of choosing a highly secure password, for fear of forgetting it.

If you don’t want to use a password manager, but you’re interested in strengthening your passwords, check out these detailed tactics and background information.

For passwords that don’t protect your most important assets, you can develop your own password algorithm, or a logic by which you invent passwords that only you can follow. The goal is to be cryptic to everyone but you, using patterns, repetition and ideas particular to you.

To create a strong password that is nevertheless easy to remember, you could take ideas that you know well, such as your mother’s name (let’s call her Alice), her birthday (let’s make it November 3, 1955) and her favorite color (let’s make it green) to create the following: 03_Alice_11_Green_55. If you throw in some special characters, the password would become even harder to crack: 03_Alice?_11_Green!_55.

On the topic of special characters: be aware that most hackers or password-cracking tools know full well that many people replace “a” with “@” and “e” with “3.”

Password patterns can allow you to use very different but related phrases for all of your accounts, basing one off of the other. For example, if you use your mother’s birthday, you could use your dad’s, brother’s, grandmother’s or dog’s for other accounts. Repeating patterns will make your passwords easy to remember, though it can put you at risk if an adversary gains access to multiple passwords and recognizes the patterns. And, of course, any pattern model becomes ineffective as soon as it is written or suggested anywhere online (so never use the one we just suggested).

Finally, take advantage of online services that offer two-factor authentication. These programs require not only a password, but also, say, a code sent to you in a text message. You input the code to verify that you are indeed the person trying to access the account. Google, Twitter and Dropbox were the first to offer this procedure. Here is a comprehensive list of websites that offer this service.
