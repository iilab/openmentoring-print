## Why choosing a strong password is important

Passwords are important for both online security and privacy. Bad passwords can easily nullify most of your other efforts.
&lt;br&gt;
Here is some basic advice on choosing passwords: Don’t use the same password across devices. Don’t use your name or account in the password. Don’t use common passwords (e.g., “12345,” family names).
&lt;br&gt;
Strong passwords are long and include a combination of lower- and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters; their strength increases with length and complexity.
