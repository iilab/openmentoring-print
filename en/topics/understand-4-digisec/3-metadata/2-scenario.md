## Scenario

Henry is a journalist writing about wildlife preservation. While working on a story about poaching recently, he came across a story that park rangers were warning people not to upload pictures to social media, and to turn off the geo-location feature on their phone.
&lt;br&gt;
The reason, he learned, was that shared photos included metadata, revealing the time and location of wild animals. Poachers had been found to be using social media to illegally wildlife and evade detection by wildlife officials.
