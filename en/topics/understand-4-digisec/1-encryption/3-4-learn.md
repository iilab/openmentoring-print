## Key fingerprints

# Verifying identity
&quot;Key fingerprints,&quot; are strings of characters like &quot;342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928&quot; that allow you to uniquely and securely check that someone on the Internet is using the right private key.
&lt;br&gt;
# Checking fingerprints
If you check that someone&#39;s key fingerprint is correct, that gives you a higher degree of certainty that it&#39;s really them.
&lt;br&gt;
# Fingerprints aren&#39;t perfect verifier
But it&#39;s not perfect, because if the keys are copied or stolen someone else would be able to use the same fingerprint.
