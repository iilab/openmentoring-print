## Key fingerprints

The word &quot;fingerprint&quot; means lots of different things in the field of computer security.
&lt;br&gt;
One use of the term is a &quot;key fingerprint,&quot; a string of characters like &quot;342e 2309 bd20 0912 ff10 6c63 2192 1928&quot; that should allow you to uniquely and securely check that someone on the Internet is using the right private key.
&lt;br&gt;
If you check that someone&#39;s key fingerprint is correct, that gives you a higher degree of certainty that it&#39;s really them.
&lt;br&gt;
But it&#39;s not perfect, because if the keys are copied or stolen someone else would be able to use the same fingerprint.
