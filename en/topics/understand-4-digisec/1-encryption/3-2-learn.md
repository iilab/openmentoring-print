## Private and public keys

One of the most important concepts to understand in encryption is a key.
&lt;br.
Common types of encryption include a private key, which is kept secret on your computer and lets you read messages that are intended only for you.
&lt;br&gt;
A private key also lets you place unforgeable digital signatures on messages you send to other people.
&lt;br&gt;
A public key is a file that you can give to others or publish that allows people to communicate with you in secret, and check signatures from you.
&lt;br&gt;
Private and public keys come in matched pairs, like the halves of a rock that has been split into two perfectly matching pieces, but they are not the same.
