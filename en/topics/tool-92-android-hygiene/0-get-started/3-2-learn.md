## Device encryption

# Turn on
If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should turn on device encryption. This can be done in *Settings -&gt; Personal -&gt; Security -&gt; Encryption.*
&lt;br&gt;
# Set a screen lock password
Before you can utilise device encryption, however, you will be required to set a screen lock password.
&lt;br&gt;
**Note:** Before starting the encryption process, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.
