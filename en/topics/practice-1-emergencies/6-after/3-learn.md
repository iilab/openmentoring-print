##What is traumatic stress
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work ,and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times. It is therefore imprint to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
&lt;br&gt;
Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal human experience can result in traumatic stress. Traumatic stress usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individualâ€™s coping mechanisms.
&lt;br&gt;
Such a response is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.
