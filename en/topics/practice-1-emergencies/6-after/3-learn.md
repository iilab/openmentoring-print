After an emergency has happened, it&#39;s a good time to go back to your emergency and security plans to see what worked and what did not.
&lt;br&gt;
When necessary, this would be a good time to try to improve your organisational procedures (e.g. procedures when on a mission or when organising a training.), determining the best practice of how to respond to an emergency or not.
&lt;br&gt;
This should be considered for all stages of an event or activity - in terms of preparation the implementation of an activity, and when an activity has ended.
&lt;br&gt;
