## Traumatic stress

![](recap.png)
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times.
&lt;br&gt;
It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
&lt;br&gt;
Traumatic Stress is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. It&#39;s very possible that after an emergency, you or your colleagues may be suffering from traumatic stress.
&lt;br&gt;
To learn about what traumatic stress is, how it affects you, and how to deal with it, refer to the [Your Well-Being](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/index.html) unit presented elsewhere in this tool.
