## Anti-virus software

Anti-virus software can be an effective first response to protecting a device from a significant percentage of malware.
&lt;br&gt;
But it is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
&lt;br&gt;
We recommend using anti-virus software as it remains a valuable defensive tool against non-targeted, but still dangerous, malware.
