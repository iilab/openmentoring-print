## Determining whether you might have malware

Before you assume that malware may be at play with your digital device, be sure to make sure you have first determined your account has not been hijacked. Refer first to the section on [Account Hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-intro.md).

&lt;br&gt;
After you have determined that account hijacking is not at play, come up with a list of indicators of compromise.
&lt;br&gt;
This term, &#39;indicators of compromise,&#39; may include the following:
- You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
- Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
- Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
&lt;br&gt;
You may also have reason to suspect your device is infected with malware if:
- Your device was seized and then returned
- Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
- Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
- Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
&lt;br&gt;

If you have answered &#39;yes&#39; to any of these questions to determine there are clear indicators of comprose and also confirming that you are not victim to an account hijacking, there are two avenues of approach: getting your devices clean or understanding the attack and then cleaning your devices.
