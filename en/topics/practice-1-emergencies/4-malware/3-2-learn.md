## Determining whether you might have malware

Before you assume malware may be at play with your device, be sure your account has not been hijacked. Refer first to the section on [Account Hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-intro.md).
&lt;br&gt;
After you have done this, come up with a list of indicators of compromise.
