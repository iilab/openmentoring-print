## Stop using your device

# Anti-virus software
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. [Anti-virus software](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/3-9-learn.md) may be good at protecting your device from common viruses, but it is mostly ineffective against sophisticated attackers.
&lt;br&gt;
# Refer to emergency plans
If you believe you are being targeted, disconnect your device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, remove the battery from your device and seek the help of a trusted security professional. Refer to your [Emergency Plans](en/topics/practice-2-planning/4-emergency-plan/1-1-intro.md).
