## ‘Cleaning’ your device
If you chose to clean your device without understanding the malware and attack first, please keep the following in mind:
&lt;br&gt;
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. A sophisticated malware infection may never go away.
&lt;br&gt;
If you believe you are being targeted by a state actor and indicators of compromise persist after using anti-virus software, disconnect the device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, if possible remove its battery and seek the help of a security professional.
