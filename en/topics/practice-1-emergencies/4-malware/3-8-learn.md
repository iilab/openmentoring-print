## &#39;Cleaning&#39; your device

If you chose to clean your device without letting the attack play out, please keep the following in mind:
&lt;br&gt;
There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. A targeted malware infection may be very hard to get rid of and you might need help from a trusted security professional.
&lt;br&gt;
If you believe you are being targeted by the state, disconnect the device from the internet, turn it off, unplug it, remove the battery from your device and seek the help of a trusted security professional.
