## Letting the attack play out

Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be more important than &#39;cleaning&#39; your computer.

It can be very valuable and empowering to gain understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.
&lt;br&gt;
If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.
&gt; bring in more from umbrella counter surveillance - physical. impliactions of counter surveillance...big investment. not easy.
make a simple statement about overt and covert surveillance - benefits and risks of doing both .
1. don&#39;t reveal by electornic communications or physical behaviour you think you&#39;re being watched
2. move activities to a safe computer - direct to seeking help.
3. work on a strategy on dealing with this, knowing that it can be taken....doing this might be perceived as an escalation. weigh pros and cons - direct people to risk analysis
