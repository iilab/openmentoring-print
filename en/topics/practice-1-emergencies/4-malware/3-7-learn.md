## Understand the attack

Your first priority may be to get your computer ‘clean’ and usable again. Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be less important to you.
&lt;br&gt;
But it can be very valuable to gain understanding of your adversary. To learn their technical capabilities and whether or not the potential attacker is known to use surveillance technology.
&lt;br&gt;
If understanding the attacker and the attack is relevant to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.
