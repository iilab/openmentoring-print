## Indicators of compromise

You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
&lt;br&gt;
Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
&lt;br&gt;
Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
&lt;br&gt;
Your device was seized and then returned
&lt;br&gt;
Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
&lt;br&gt;
Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
&lt;br&gt;
Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
&lt;br&gt;
If your device shows clear indicators of compromise and you have also determined that you are not the victim of account hijacking, you can either &#39;let the attack play out&#39; or &#39;clean&#39; your device.
