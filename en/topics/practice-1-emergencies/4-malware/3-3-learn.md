## Steps to minimise risk of malware infection

Anti-virus software can be an effective first response to protecting a device from a significant percentage of malware. However, anti-virus software is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, it remains a valuable defensive tool against non-targeted, but still dangerous, malware. Below is a non-exhaustive list of options:

- Microsoft Safety Scanner (Windows)
- F-Secure
- Kaspersky
- ClamXav (Mac OS X)
- TrendMicro
- ClamAV (Windows and Linux)
&lt;br&gt;
When you run anti-virus software, ensure that it is up to date. If a virus is detected the following four steps are recommended.
&lt;br&gt;
Step 1: Ensure that your anti-virus software is up to date
&lt;br&gt;
Step 2: Take a screenshot of the message
&lt;br&gt;
Step 3: Continue with the recommended steps to remove the virus
&lt;br&gt;
Step 4: Following the guidelines in the Safer Communication section above, send the screenshot to a person with security expertise
