## Indicators of compromise

This term, &#39;indicators of compromise,&#39; may include the following:
&lt;br&gt;
You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
&lt;br&gt;
Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
&lt;br&gt;
Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
&lt;br&gt;
Your device was seized and then returned
&lt;br&gt;
Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
&lt;br&gt;
Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
&lt;br&gt;
Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
&lt;br&gt;
If you have answered &#39;yes&#39; to any of these questions to determine there are clear indicators of compromise and also confirming that you are not victim to an account hijacking, you can do two things:
&lt;br&gt;1) clean your devices
&lt;br&gt;2) understand the attack and then clean your devices.
