Malware is malicious software that facilitates an unauthorized takeover of your device by another user, government or third party to perform surveillance functions such as recording keystrokes, stealing passwords, taking screenshots, recording audio, video and more.
&lt;br&gt;
While most malware is designed for and utilized by criminals, state-sponsored actors have increasingly adopted malware as a tool for surveillance, espionage and sabotage.
&lt;br&gt;
Malware exploits access to the device to send out spam, seize banking, email or social media credentials, shut down websites and collect vital information from journalists, human rights defenders, NGOs, activists and bloggers.
&lt;br&gt;
If you suspect a malware infection on your device here are some things you can do:
&lt;br&gt;

Before you assume that malware may be at play with your digital device, be sure to make sure you have first determined your account has not been hijacked. Refer first to the section on Account Hijacking.

&lt;br&gt;
After you have determined that account hijacking is not at play, come up with a list of indicators of compromise.
&lt;br&gt;
This term, &#39;indicators of compromise,&#39; may include the following:
- You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious
- Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam
- Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password
&lt;br&gt;
You may also have reason to suspect your device is infected with malware if:
- Your device was seized and then returned
- Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device
- Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer
- Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities
&lt;br&gt;

If you have answered &#39;yes&#39; to any of these questions to determine there are clear indicators of comprose and also confirming that you are not victim to an account hijacking, there are two avenues of approach: getting your devices clean or understanding the attack and then cleaning your devices.

&lt;br&gt;


Your first priority may be to get your computer ‘clean’ and usable again. Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be less important to you. However, it can be very valuable to gain understanding of your adversary, their technical capabilities and whether or not the potential attacker (a government entity or other third party) is known to use internet surveillance technology.
&lt;br&gt;
If understanding the attacker and the attack is relevant to you, it is essential that collecting and analyzing information on a potential malware infection happens before you engage in ‘cleaning’ your computer.
&lt;br&gt;
‘Cleaning’ your device
When you have chosen to clean your device without understanding the malware and attack first please keep the following in mind:

- There is no quick fix to clean up malware from you computer. Even after completing the following steps a very sophisticated malware infection may still be present. These steps are sufficient to remove most of the malware you are likely to encounter unless you are being targeted by a very advanced attacker.
&lt;br&gt;
- If you believe that you are being targeted by a state actor and indicators of compromise persist after cleaning up the virus detected through the steps below, disconnect it from the internet, turn off the device, unplug it, if possible remove its battery and seek the help of a security professional.
&lt;br&gt;
Anti-virus

Anti-virus software can be an effective first response to protecting a device from a significant percentage of malware. However, anti-virus software is generally considered ineffective against targeted attacks, especially by state-sponsored actors.
&lt;br&gt;
Nevertheless, it remains a valuable defensive tool against non-targeted, but still dangerous, malware. Below is a non-exhaustive list of options:

- Microsoft Safety Scanner (Windows)
- F-Secure
- Kaspersky
- ClamXav (Mac OS X)
- TrendMicro
- ClamAV (Windows and Linux)
&lt;br&gt;
When you run anti-virus software, ensure that it is up to date. If a virus is detected the following four steps are recommended.
&lt;br&gt;
Step 1: Ensure that your anti-virus software is up to date
&lt;br&gt;
Step 2: Take a screenshot of the message
&lt;br&gt;
Step 3: Continue with the recommended steps to remove the virus
&lt;br&gt;
Step 4: Following the guidelines in the Safer Communication section above, send the screenshot to a person with security expertise
