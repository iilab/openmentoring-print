## Letting the attack play out

Your first priority may be to get your computer ‘clean’ and usable again. Finding out what has happened to you and who has targeted you may be less important to you. But it can be very valuable and empowering to gain understanding of your adversary through letting the attack play out.
&lt;br&gt;
If understanding the attacker and the attack is important to you, you must collect and analyse information when a potential malware infection happens. Do this before ‘cleaning’ your computer.
