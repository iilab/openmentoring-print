# Malware

## 7 indicators of compromise

1. You opened an attachment or link that you think may have been malicious. Links or attachments are often the cause of malware infections.
&lt;br&gt;
2. Your webcam LED turns on when you are not using the webcam. This may indicate your device is being accessed remotely.
&lt;br&gt;
3. Your accounts have been compromised multiple times, even after you have changed the password. This may indicate someone has control of your device.
&lt;br&gt;
4. Your device was seized and then returned. It is possible that your device may have been infected with malware when it was taken from you.
&lt;br&gt;
5. Someone broke into your home and may have tampered with your device. This may indicate that your device was infected with malware during the break in.
&lt;br&gt;
6. Some of your personal data has been made public and it could only come from your personal computer. This may indicate that someone has access to your computer.
&lt;br&gt;
7. Your group is being targeted by a government, law enforcement, or an actor with equivalent capabilities.

If your device shows clear indicators of compromise and you have also determined that you are not the victim of [account hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md), you can either &#39;let the attack play out&#39; or &#39;clean&#39; your device.
