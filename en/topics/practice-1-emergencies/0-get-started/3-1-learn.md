## Verify if the problem is real

# Assess the situation
You might want to seek help, but assessing the situation first can help you fix the problem on your own or be more prepared when you reach out for help.
&lt;br&gt;
# Where is the information from?
Make sure you verify where the information is coming from. Was it via email? Did you see an error message on a website? Has someone told you about the problem?
&lt;br&gt;
# Do you trust the source?
Verify that the information is coming from a source you trust: do you recognise the email address, or the website address? Fake emails could be sent to mislead you into giving information about your accounts.
