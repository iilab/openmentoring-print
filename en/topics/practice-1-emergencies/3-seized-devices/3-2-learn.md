Think about the kinds of security protections the device had in place:
&lt;br&gt;
- Was the device protected by a password or other security measures?
&lt;br&gt;
- Which operating system was running on the device? Was this a legal version, or was it an illegal, jailbroken or rooted version?
&lt;br&gt;
- Does the device have full disk encryption turned on?
&lt;br&gt;
- What state was your device in when it was lost? Were you logged in? Was the device on but password-locked? Was it sleeping or hibernating? Completely turned off?
&lt;br&gt;
- Do you have remote access to the device?
