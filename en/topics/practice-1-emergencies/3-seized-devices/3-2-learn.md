Sometimes having a device seized means that people have been compromised as a result of sensitive information getting in the wrong hands.

Think about what assets you have that can be compromising to people and work out a way to let them know. Do this as securely as possible, as explained in the [Secure Communications](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications) lesson.
