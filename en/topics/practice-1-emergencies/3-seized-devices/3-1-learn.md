Should you believe your device is seized, start by answering some simple questions:
&lt;br&gt;
- What happened?
&lt;br&gt;
- What sort of device are you missing? A computer, mobile phone, tablet or an external hard drive?
&lt;br&gt;
- When and where did you lose the device?
&lt;br&gt;
- How did you lose the device? Was it stolen by another person, taken by a state authority or did you simply lose track of it?
&lt;br&gt;
-Is the device still missing?
