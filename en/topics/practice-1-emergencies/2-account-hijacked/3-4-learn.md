## Deal with being locked out of your account

If you cannot log into your account, use the password reset or recovery link.
&lt;br&gt;
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
&lt;br&gt;
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Most providers have a &quot;Support&quot; page where you can find out how to do this.
