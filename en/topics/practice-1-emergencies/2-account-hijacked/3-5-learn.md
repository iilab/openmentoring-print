Different providers have different recovery procedures or ways to reset passwords.
&lt;br&gt;
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
&lt;br&gt;
In the reset case, it is important to change the password immediately after regaining access to your account.
