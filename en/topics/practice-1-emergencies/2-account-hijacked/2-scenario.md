Brenda receives an email from her service provider alerting her that her social media account password has recently changed. She suspects her social media account has been hijacked.
&lt;br&gt;
She needs to know if she still has access to the account, and if not, who she can reach out to for help. Brenda is worried that if she doesn&#39;t regain control, her social media account will be used to hurt her reputation.
