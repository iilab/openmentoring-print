## Other places to check for suspicious activity

Check for suspicious addresses which your email might be automatically forwarding your emails to.
&lt;br&gt;
Also check email addresses or phone numbers listed when you&#39;re resetting your password (this might be called password recovery settings).
&lt;br&gt;
Also look at the settings for the synchronisation to your phone, permissions to applications or other account permissions.
