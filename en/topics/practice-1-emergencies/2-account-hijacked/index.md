# Account Hijacking

## Learn

For some platforms (e.g. Facebook, Gmail), it is possible to review conneciton history and account activity.
&lt;br&gt;
Check to see if your account was accessed at a time when you were not online or if your account was accessed from an unfamiliar location or IP address. 
&lt;br&gt;
Be mindful that if you are using the Tor browser or a VPN service, it is possible that the location or IP address may differ from the location you have accessed the platform.
