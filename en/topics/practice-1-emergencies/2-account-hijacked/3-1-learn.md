## Mitigating the problem

Should you suspect your account has been hijacked, the first step you should take is mitigating the problem.
&lt;br&gt;
##If you have access to the account
If you still have access to the account, take the following steps:
- Move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised
- Log into your account from the new computer and change the password on your account
- Stop using this account for sharing of sensitive information until you better understand the situation.

##If you do not have access to the account
If you no longer have access to the account, different providers have different recovery procedures or ways to reset passwords.
&lt;br&gt;
Some providers will send a link to change your password to your recovery email address, while other platforms reset it to your last password.
&lt;br&gt;
In the reset case, it is important to change the password immediately after regaining access to your account.
&lt;br&gt;
If these steps do not work and your account is being abused, contact the platform provider directly. Alternatively, contact the following organisations for possible support in shutting the account down.
