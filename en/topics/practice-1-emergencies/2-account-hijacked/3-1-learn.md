## If you can login

Move to a different computer that you believe to be safe or uncompromised. If you continue using an unsafe computer, you risk putting yourself and others at harm.
&lt;br&gt;
Log into your account from the new computer and change the password on your account. Changing your password is the fastest way to regain control of your account.
&lt;br&gt;
Change the passwords for all your other online accounts that are linked to your hijacked account. For example, if you are looking at an email account and it is the recovery address for another account, change the password for that account as well.
&lt;br&gt;
Now time to confirm if your suspicions are founded? The next instructions will help you determine if your account has been hijacked.
&lt;br&gt;
Until you better understand the situation we recommend you stop using this account for sharing sensitive information.
