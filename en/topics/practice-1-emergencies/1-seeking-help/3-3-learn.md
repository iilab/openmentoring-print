Seeking and providing remote help

When you are seeking remote help from a third party please keep the following in mind:
- If you think there is something wrong with one of your devices or accounts and you are uncomfortable or unsure about what to do next, ask for help from a trained technical professional or (inter)national organizations (some listed below) whom you feel you can trust.
&lt;br&gt;
- Remember that the device you are using might be the subject of the attack.
- In order to establish a secure line of communication with a person who can help you, it may be necessary to contact them from an alternate, trustworthy device.
&lt;br&gt;
- The guides referenced in the [Next Steps](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/1-seeking-help/7-next.md) section can also help.
- If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.

Things to keep in mind when reaching for help
Whether you are helping someone remotely or seeking help from a third party, establishing trust is both very important and extremely complicated.
&lt;br&gt;
You should presume an adversary may have access to all your account details as well as your original communications when seeking help.

This adversary has an obvious interest in intercepting your secure communications channel and providing specific, bad advice.
&lt;br&gt;
Security tools have built-in ways to verify if the person you are talking to is actually the person you think you are talking to.

When getting advice, compare it to concepts discussed on well-respected guides such as [Security in a Box](https://securityinabox.org/), resources at [EFF](https://ssd.eff.org/en) and [Press Freedom Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works).
