    &lt;question&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With end-to-end encryption the company providing the service is able to read my content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;answer&gt;Yes&lt;/answer&gt;
        &lt;answer correct&gt;No&lt;/answer&gt;
        &lt;explanation&gt;End-to-end encryption means that only you and the person you&#39;re communicating with have the encryption keys. If the keys are not available to anyone else, then no one can eavesdrop on your communications.&lt;/explanation&gt;
    &lt;/question&gt;
    &lt;question&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With transport layer encryption the company providing the service is able to read my content.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;answer correct&gt;Yes&lt;/answer&gt;
        &lt;answer&gt;No&lt;/answer&gt;
        &lt;explanation&gt;With transport-layer encryption (HTTPS), the communication is encrypted between you and the company&#39;s server. In other words, it&#39;s the internet company that is providing the encryption and they have the encryption keys. In the end-to-end case you and the person you&#39;re communicating with are providing the encryption.&lt;/explanation&gt;
    &lt;/question&gt;
