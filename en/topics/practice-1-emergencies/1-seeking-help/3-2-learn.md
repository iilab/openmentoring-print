## Encrypted channels

Sending encrypted communication is like placing the postcard inside a safe and then sending the safe, which only you and those you trust know the combination to and are able to open and read the message.
&lt;br&gt;
Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation and the activities in which you are involved.
&lt;br&gt;
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption is recommended. PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Signal on your phone encrypt messages &quot;all the way&quot; (between you and your recipient).
&lt;br&gt;
If an end-to-end encrypted tool is not available, use tools that encrypt message only between you and the provider. Such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter which all use HTTPS.
&lt;br&gt;
This, in turn, is better than using unencrypted communications (such as a postcard, your phone or text messages). Do the best that you can with the resources and skills available.
