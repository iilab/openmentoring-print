How to ask for help
Start with the most secure form of communication you can manage and the person you reach out to may be able to help you establish a line of communications that is more secure, if necessary.

In many cases, it is better to reach out for help insecurely than not to reach out for help at all.
&lt;br&gt;
If you believe that your computer has been compromised by malware and the device you are using cannot be trusted, please go directly to the [Malware](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-intro.md) section.
&lt;br&gt;
If you think that your communication might be targeted and/or you have just changed to a safer computer, the [Safer Emailing](link needed here!) section and [Safer Phones](en/topics/practice-3-safe-phones/0-getting-started/1-intro.md)section to establish secure communications.

&lt;br&gt;
Seeking and providing remote help

When you are seeking remote help from a third party please keep the following in mind:
- If you think there is something wrong with one of your devices or accounts and you are uncomfortable or unsure about what to do next, ask for help from a trained technical professional or (inter)national organizations (some listed below) whom you feel you can trust.
&lt;br&gt;
- Remember that the device you are using might be the subject of the attack.
- In order to establish a secure line of communication with a person who can help you, it may be necessary to contact them from an alternate, trustworthy device.
&lt;br&gt;
- The guides referenced in the [Next Steps](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/1-seeking-help/7-next.md) section can also help.
- If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.
