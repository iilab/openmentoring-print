How to ask for help
Start with the most secure form of communication you can manage and the person you reach out to may be able to help you establish a line of communications that is more secure, if necessary.

In many cases, it is better to reach out for help insecurely than not to reach out for help at all.

If you believe that your computer has been compromised by malware and the device you are using cannot be trusted, please go directly to the [Malware](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/4-malware/1-intro.md) section.
&lt;br&gt;
If you think that your communication might be targeted and/or you have just changed to a safer computer, the [Safer Emailing](link needed here!) section and [Safer Phones](en/topics/practice-3-safe-phones/0-getting-started/1-intro.md)section to establish secure communications.
