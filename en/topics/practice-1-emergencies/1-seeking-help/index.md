# Seeking Remote Help

## Establishing trust when reaching out

Whether you are helping someone remotely or seeking help from a third party, establishing trust is very important.
&lt;br&gt;
It might be safer to presume that an adversary may have access to all your account details as well as your communications when seeking help and might be attempting to provide specific, bad advice.
&lt;br&gt;
If you know the party you&#39;re reaching out to, using a video call or a phone call will help establish that you&#39;re really in contact with them.
&lt;br&gt;
When you are initiating contact with third parties you might want to create a new email account from a trusted device. If possible, do not rely on unknown people you find online.
