**Basic introduction to encryption and secure communication**
As a general rule, it is important to understand that most ‘normal’ communications tools are not very secure against eavesdropping.
&lt;br&gt;
**Normal communication**
Mobile and landline phone communication is not encrypted and can be listened to by governments, law enforcement agencies, or other parties with the necessary technical equipment. 
&lt;br&gt;
Sending unencrypted communication is like sending a postcard, anyone who has access to the postcard can read the message. 
&lt;br&gt;
**Encrypted communication**
Sending encrypted communication is like placing the postcard inside a safe and then sending the safe, which only you and those you trust know the combination to and are able to open and read the message.
&lt;br&gt;
Secure communication is always a trade-off between security and convenience. Choosing the most appropriate form of secure communication will depend on your unique situation, your threat model and the activities in which you are involved.
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, when communicating there are different levels of security. How and what kind of encryption a tool makes use of will increase or decrease your communication security.
&lt;br&gt;
A communication tool that provides end-to-end encryption (such a PGP-encrypted email, or chat with OTR or Textsecure on your phone) is better than using a tool with transport-layer encryption (such as Gmail, Facebook, or Twitter).
&lt;br&gt;
This, in turn, is better than using unencrypted communications (such as a postcard, your phone or text messages). Do the best that you can with the resources and skills available.
