## Normal Communication

![](recap.png)

As a general rule, it is important to understand that most ‘normal’ communications tools are not very secure against eavesdropping.
&lt;br&gt;
Mobile and landline phone communication is not encrypted and can be listened to by governments, law enforcement agencies, or other parties with the necessary technical equipment. 
&lt;br&gt;
Sending unencrypted communication is like sending a postcard, anyone who has access to the postcard can read the message.
