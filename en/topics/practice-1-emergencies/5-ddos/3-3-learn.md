## First steps to take if your website is down or defaced

Finding the problem and possible solutions to your websiteâ€™s problem can be cumbersome if you do not have hosting expertise. Therefore, when possible, the best first step is to contact a trusted person who can help with your website (e.g. webmaster or the people who helped you set up your site)
&lt;br&gt;
Start by answering some simple questions:
- Who built your website? Are they available to help?
- Who is your web hosting provider? This is the company that provides the server where your website lives. If you do not know, you can use a tool like this to help.
- Do you have your account log in details for this hosting provider?
- Where did you purchase your domain name? In some cases this is also your website host, but it could also be another company.
- Do you have the log in details for the domain name service? If not, finding these is your first step to recovering your site
- Who else knows or may have access to these account details?
&lt;br&gt;
After answering these questions, take the following first steps to mitigate the problem.
