## Is your website defaced?

&gt;Step 1
#Verify you website is defaced

 Verify that this is a malicious takeover of your website. An unfortunate but legal practice is to buy recently expired domain names to ‘take over’ the traffic they had for advertising purposes.
&lt;br&gt;
To prevent this, it is very important to keep payments for your domain name in order.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 2
#Regain control of your website

If your website has been defaced, first regain control of your website login account and reset its password, see the [Account Hijacking](en/topics/practice-1-emergencies/2-account-hijacked/1-1-intro.md) section for help.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 3
#Make a backup of the defaced website

Make a backup of the defaced site that can later be used for investigation of the defacement.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 4
#Turn off your website

Temporarily turn off your website – use a simple landing page or ‘parked’ page.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 5
#Determine how your site was hacked

Determine how your site was hacked. Your hosting provider may be able to help.
&lt;br&gt;
Common problems are older parts of your site with custom scripts/tools running on them, out of date content management systems, and custom programming with security flaws.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 6
#Restore your original website

Restore your original from backups. If neither you, nor your hosting company have backups, you may have to re-build your website from scratch!
&lt;br&gt;
Also note that if your only backups are at your hosting provider, an attacker may be able to delete those when they take control of your site!
&lt;br&gt;
&gt;Step 7
#Use a DDoS mitigation service

Move to a DDoS Mitigation service or secure hosting provider. Deflect.ca can support you in protecting your site from online attacks. CloudFlare can also block many common attacks.
&lt;br&gt;
Secure hosting providers such as VirtualRoad/Qurium go to great lengths to detect and prevent such attacks.
