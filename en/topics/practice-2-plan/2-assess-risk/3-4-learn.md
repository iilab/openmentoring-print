## Understand threats, capacities, and vulnerabilities

Think of your risk as an interplay of the threats you face, your vulnerabilities, and the capacities you have.
&lt;br&gt;
# Threats
Threats refer to a declaration or indication of an intention to inflict harm. The higher the threats, the higher your risk.
&lt;br&gt;
An example of a threat may be someone breaking into your email account and exposing your contacts, or using your emails as evidence against you.
&lt;br&gt;
# Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities refer to any factor which makes it more likely for harm to materialise or result in greater damage. The more vulnerabilities you have, the higher your risk.
&lt;br&gt;
An example of a vulnerability may be having a very short, simple and easy to break password, like &#39;123456&#39;.
&lt;br&gt;
# Capacities
Capacities refer to abilities and resources which improve our security. The higher your capacities, the LOWER your risk.
&lt;br&gt;
An example might be knowing how to create and store long, complex and varied passwords, thus making it very difficult for people to break into your email account.
&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s worth noting that capacities and vulnerabilities are often &quot;two sides of the same coin&quot;.
