## Edit an existing entry

# Step 1. Select &#39;Internet&#39; group
Select the ’Internet’ Group in the database menu on the left side of the window to see the entries associated with it.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 2: Find your entry
In this example, we’ll use the Riseup account entry we created in Step 4.1 above. Within the ’Internet’ Group, Select the Riseup entry we created by clicking it within the list of entries inside the ’Internet’ Group.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 3. Open your entry
There are three ways to open up the entry in order to edit it.
&lt;br&gt;
# Option 1. Right click on entry
You can ‘right click’ on the selected entry by holding down the Control key and clicking the entry, which activates a menu of options.Then scroll down and click on View/Edit Entry.
&lt;br&gt;
# Option 2. Use KeePassX menu
In the KeePassX menu, select Entries, then New Database.
&lt;br&gt;
# Option 3. Use a shortcut
Use the View/Edit Entry shortcut key combination: Command-E.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 4. Edit information
With an open entry, you can add new information or edit any existing information, including the password. To save your changes, click {OK}.
&lt;br&gt;
# Update information elsewhere
Note: Remember that making changes to a KeePassX entry only updates that entry in your KeePassX database. It does not automatically update corresponding information elsewhere, such as a new password for an online account, or the same KeePassX entry in any copies or backups of your KeePassX database that you have saved elsewhere.
&lt;br&gt;
# Update relevant account information
Therefore, you will need to make any relevant updates to your account information, as well as new KeePassX database backups and copies seperately after editing your entry here.
