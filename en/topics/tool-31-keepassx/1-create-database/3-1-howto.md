## Steps to create a KeepassX database

# Step 1.
In the KeePassX menu, select File, then New Database.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 2.
Choose a strong and memorable master passphrase, then enter it. Refer to the [Passwords lesson](topics/understand-4-digisec/2-passwords/1-1-intro.md) to learn how to do so
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 3. (Optional)
If you want to see the master passphrase you have chosen and entered, you can click the {â€˜eye&#39; button} to the right of the entry field. (Be aware of your current circumstances, however. An untrusted person nearby may see your exposed master passphrase!)
&lt;br&gt;
# Re-hide your password
To re-hide your master password, click the {&#39;eye&#39; button} again.
&lt;br&gt;
#Step 4.
Click {OK} to proceed.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 5.
Enter your chosen master passphrase a second time to make sure you got it right. Click {OK}.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 6. (Optional)
If the two entries don&#39;t match, click {Back} and re-enter your password, then follow steps 3 through 5.
