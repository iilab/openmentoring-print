# What is KeepassX
Password managers are considered to be the most secure way to use complex and varying passwords and still remember them. KeePassX is an open-source password manager, and once you&#39;ve set your master password, it creates and saves passwords for you.

# Synchronising password databases
To enhance convenience, you can synchronise your password database - for example, by using a cloud service, so that you can access your passwords on various computers as well as your phone. That way, you&#39;ll have round the clock access to strong passwords.
