Learn about the various elements in a KeePassX entry.

The Add Entry window presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience.

A brief explanation of the text fields and elements in a KeePassX entry is presented as follows: - Group: KeePassX lets you sort your passwords into pre-defined groups. For example: &#39;Internet&#39; would be a good place to store passwords that relate to website accounts. Click on the drop-down menu to choose a group. - Icon: The icon that will be associated with this account entry. If you click on the icon button, you can see the icons available in the Icon Selection window. You also have the option to add a custom icon by clicking on the ’Add Custom Icon’ button in the bottom left of the Icon Selection window. To select one of the KeePassX icons available, click the Pick button in the bottom right of the window.
