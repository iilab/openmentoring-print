## Tor Basics

The Tor Browser is a software tool designed to increase the privacy and security of your Internet activities and habits. It masks your identity and your on-line browsing from many forms of Internet surveillance. Tor can also be useful as a secure means of circumventing electronic restrictions so that you may access or publish blogs and news reports.

Tor protects your anonymity by routing communications through a distributed network of servers run by volunteers from all over the world. Using Tor hides the sites you visit from potential onlookers, and hides your location/identity from those sites. The software is designed also to make sure servers in the Tor network don&#39;t know both your location and the sites you are visiting.

Tor also takes steps to encrypt the communication to and through its network, but this measure can not extend all the way to a website which is sending or receiving content over non-encrypted channels (i.e. not providing https access). Nevertheless, the advantage of using Tor when accessing such sites is that Tor can secure your communication up to the step between the last of the Tor servers and the non-secure site. This confines the chance to intercept the content to that last step.

The Tor Browser Bundle consists of the Tor software and a modified version of the Firefox web browser, which is designed to provide extra protection while using it. The browser bundle also includes NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere add-ons.

Note: There is a trade-off between anonymity and speed. Because Tor facilitates anonymous browsing by bouncing your traffic through volunteers&#39; computers and servers in various parts of the world, it will definitely be slower than using other web browsers on your computer.

    Bridge Relay: A Bridge Relay is a Tor server that is not publicly announced. If you choose to use a bridge, the server can provide you with access to the Tor network even if Tor is blocked in your country.

    Port: In this chapter, a port is an access point through which software communicates with services running on other networked computers. If a URL, such as www.google.com, gives you the &#39;street address&#39; of a service, then the port tells you which &#39;door&#39; to use once you reach the correct destination. When browsing the Web, you typically use port 80 for unsecured sites (http://mail.google.com) and port 443 for secured ones (https://mail.google.com).

    Proxy: A proxy is a software intermediary that runs on your computer, on your local network, or somewhere else on the Internet, that helps to relay your communication toward its final destination.

    Route: A route is the communication path on the Internet between your computer and the destination server.
