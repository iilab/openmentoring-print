## Understand risk

In order to know what measures to take in order to be more secure, both digitally and in our day-to-day personal and professional
activities, it&#39;s important to understand the nature of the risks we face. This way, you can make the right decisions about how best to stay safe.
&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps without realising, we take decisions based on risk analyses every day. You may choose not to walk home through a particular neighbourhood you consider dangerous, or to lock your office doors when you leave in the evening, to deter thieves.
&lt;br&gt;
The idea of this lesson is to consider that same logic, as it applies to our activities both as journalists and as private people.
