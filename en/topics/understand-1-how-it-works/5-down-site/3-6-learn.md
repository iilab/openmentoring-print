## Hosting problem

![](recap.png)

If your website is not loading at all, the company that hosts your website may be having problems.
&lt;br&gt;
Visit the website of your hosting company and look for a &#39;status&#39; blog. Alternatively, you can search on Twitter.com for other users with the same host who are having the same problem.
