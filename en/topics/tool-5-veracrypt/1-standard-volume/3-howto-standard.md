## Creating a standard encrypted volume

# Step 1. Open Veracrypt
Launch VeraCrypt to open the main application window

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 2. Begin the Volume Creation Wizard
Click [Create Volume] to activate the following VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window

&lt;br&gt;
A VeraCrypt container file is an encrypted volume that is stored within a single file. This container can be renamed, moved, copied or deleted like any other file.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 3. Choose the type of volume to create
Click [Next] to select which type of volume you would like to create:

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 4. Choose a name and location
Make sure that Standard VeraCrypt Volume is selected and click [Next] to choose a name and location for your VeraCrypt container file.

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 5. Choose where your volume lives
Click [Select File…] to choose a location for your VeraCrypt container file and specify a name for it.

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 6. Find your encrypted volume
Navigate to the folder in which you would like to create your container
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 7. Name your encrypted volume
Choose a filename for your container and type it into the field at the top of the window
&lt;br&gt;
Do not select a file that already exists! And be sure to remember where you put your container and what you call it.
&lt;br&gt;
In this example, we created a container called volume on the Desktop, but your container can have any filename and any file extension.
&lt;br&gt;
For example, you can name your container recipes.docx or holidays.mpg in hopes that a casual observer will think it is a Microsoft Word document or a video file.
&lt;br&gt;
This is one way you can help disguise the existence of a VeraCrypt container, but it will not work against someone with the time and resources to search your device thoroughly.
&lt;br&gt;
If you want to create a VeraCrypt container on a USB storage device, simply navigate to the device (rather than to a folder on your computer) before choosing a filename.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 8. Save your encrypted volume
 Click [Save] once you have determined a location and chosen name for your VeraCrypt container file:

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 9. Configure your encryption Options
Click [Next] to configure your Encryption Options

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 10. Configure volume size
Click [Next] to select a volume size

&lt;br&gt;
The Volume Size window lets you specify the size of the container you are about to create. In this section, we will create a 250 MB volume, but you might want to specify a different size.
&lt;br&gt;
Consider the number of files — and, more importantly, the types of files — you intend to store in your encrypted volume. Image files and videos, in particular, can fill up a small VeraCrypt container very quickly.
&lt;br&gt;
Tip: If you think you might want to backup your container file on a CD, you should choose a size that is 700 MB or less.
&lt;br&gt;
For a DVD backup, it should be 4.5 GB or less. If you intend to upload the container file to an online storage service, you will have to determine a reasonable size based on the speed of your Internet connection.
&lt;br&gt;
Type the size of the volume you would like to create. Make sure you select the correct value for KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), GB (gigabytes) or TB (terabytes).
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 12. Choose a passphrase
Click [Next] to choose a passphrase and refer to the [password lesson](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/2-passwords/1-1-intro.md) to learn how to do so safely

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 13. Enter your new passphrase
Type your passphrase and then re-type it into the Confirm field to activate the Next button.
&lt;br&gt;
#Step 14. Select filesystem type
Click [Next] to select a filesystem type
![12.png](12.png)
&lt;br&gt;
Note: The default value (&quot;FAT&quot;) will work for most people and is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS X computers. However, if you intend to store files that are larger than 4 GB (for a single file), then you will have to select a different Filesystem type.
&lt;br&gt;
Linux Ext2 will only work on Linux computers, and NTFS will work on Windows computers and most Linux computers.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 15. Add random data
Click [Next] after choosing an appropriate Filesystem type
![13.png](13.png)
&lt;br&gt;
VeraCrypt is now ready to create a standard encrypted volume within a container file. If you move your mouse within the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard window, it will produce random data that will help strengthen the encryption.
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 16. Create your standard volume
Click [Format] to begin creating your standard volume.
&lt;br&gt;
VeraCrypt will let you know when it has finished creating your encrypted volume.
![14.png](14.png)
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 17. Click [OK]
![13.png](13.png)
&lt;br&gt;
# Step 18. Close the VeraCrypt volume.
&lt;br&gt;
Click [Exit] to close the VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard and return to VeraCrypt&#39;s main window. (If you click [Next], VeraCrypt will begin walking you through the process of creating another encrypted volume.)
&lt;br&gt;
You should now see your 250 MB container file in the location you chose in Step 6.
