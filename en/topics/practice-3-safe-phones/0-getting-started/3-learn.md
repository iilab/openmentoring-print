## Safer commmunication on a smart phone


If you only have a smartphone, be aware that your phone is generally tied to your identity. This happens through billing, account services or SIM card registration, and can reveal your location.
&lt;br&gt;
Encrypted messaging tools do not protect about sharing this, but they do help protect the content of your communication. Use the following Android apps for secure communication:
&lt;br&gt;
ChatSecure by The Guardian Project integrates with desktop chat Clients like Jitsi and Pidgin (using Gchat or Jabber/XMPP) and adds end-to-end encryption and the ability to send encrypted files, photos and audio.
&lt;br&gt;
With csipsimple you can also make secure calls (such as from Ostel).
&lt;br&gt;
RedPhone (for voice) and TextSecure (for SMS) by WhisperSystems are good, but both you and the person you are communicating with must be on Android (with these tools installed) in order for these tools to work.
&lt;br&gt;
Orbot by The Guardian Project and the Tor Project is an application that allows mobile phone users to access the web, instant messaging and email without being monitored or blocked by their mobile internet service provider. It brings the features and functionality of Tor to the Android mobile operating system.
