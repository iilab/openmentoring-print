## Conversations basics

# Messaging App
Conversations is an open source chat client that encrypts messages using a Jabber/XMPP client. It can also be used for group chats.
&lt;br&gt;
# Encrypted content
Using Conversations will prevent anyone from being able to read the content of your messages, but will not hide that you are sending messages, nor will it hide that your recipient is receiving messages.
&lt;br&gt;
# Think about the risks
In some countries, an encryption app such as Conversations may attract attention, be illegal or subject to legal constraints.
&lt;br&gt;
# Installation guide
