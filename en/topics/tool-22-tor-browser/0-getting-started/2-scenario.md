## Scenario

Henry and Grace are journalists in a Kampala suburb who mantain a blog on which they anonymously publicise corruption practices and campaign for political change. 

&lt;br&gt;

The authorities in Uganda have not been able to shut down their website, because it is hosted in another country, but they have often tried to learn the identity of the blog&#39;s administrators from other journalists.

&lt;br&gt;

Henry and Grace are concerned that the authorities may be able to monitor their updates and learn who they are.

&lt;br&gt;

In addition,they want to prepare for when the government eventually filters their website so that they can continue updating it and also provide good circumvention advice to readers all over the country who would otherwise lose access to the blog.
