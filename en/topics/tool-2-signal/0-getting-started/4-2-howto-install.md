&gt;Confirming number

&lt;br&gt;
# Step 2: Confirm registration
Signal will send you an SMS message to confirm registration.
&lt;br&gt;
Note: If for some reason you do not receive the SMS you will be given the option to receive an automated phone call where you will hear a 6-digit code, this code once entered will complete the registration.
