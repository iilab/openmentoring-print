## Keeping backups of information


Loss of digital information from computer theft or collapse is fairly common in many countries. In some countries, confiscation and destruction of computers by government security agents is also something that you should be wary of.
&lt;br&gt;
Fortunately, you can take measures to ensure that you recover your most important information in the unfortunate event that you should lose a computer either through theft, system collapse, or confiscation/destruction by your adversaries.
&lt;br&gt;
Your best bet is to keep a backup of your important information. When creating a backup:
&lt;br&gt;
- Identify your important information and organize it in one place, such as a folder in your computer.
- Select a backup storage medium that allows you to replace your backup document with its latest version. An external hard disk drive (HDD), which connects to your computer via USB, has become the storage medium of choice for many.
&lt;br&gt;
External HDDs can offer storage space of up to 6TB. It is, however, recommended that you store your backups on smaller HDDs, from 350MB to 1TB, which you can keep in separate locations.
&lt;br&gt;
Keep your backups in a separate location from your computer. This ensures that you do not lose both the files on your computer and your backup at the same time. Keeping a couple of backups in different locations is good practice, as long as these too are secured.
&lt;br&gt;
You can also store your backups on remote servers via the internet â€“ on what is now known as the cloud. Ensure you choose a secure online storage service. Consider secure services like Tresorit and SpiderOak, which are both quite secure and reliable.
