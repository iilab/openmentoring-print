## Publicising a march...

Brenda and Isaac are going to a march and want to use Facebook to publicise the event. They are worried that the authorities could be tipped off and that anyone who shows an interest could be traced.
&lt;br&gt;
They plan to share photos and videos of the march without revealing people&#39;s identities, because they worry that participants could face persecution.
