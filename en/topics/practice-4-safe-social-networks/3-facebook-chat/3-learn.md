## Facebook communication basics

When you communicate over Facebook without the use of encryption, the company and all other third parties it potentially shares your data with can have access to the content of your instant messages (IM) and voice calls (VoIP).
&lt;br&gt;
This includes ranges from other advertising companies to law enforcement agencies. Not only can insecure communication potentially expose your data to beach, but also that of your contacts.
&lt;br&gt;
To enhance the privacy and security of your communications, you can install Jitsi: a client which supports the Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol for IM encryption and ZRTP for VoIP encryption.
&lt;br&gt;
OTR clients like Jitsi not only makes the content of your communications inaccessible to various third parties, such as governments and corporations, it also makes it inaccessible to Facebook.
