## Social networking basics

# What it does
Social networking websites have greatly expanded the range of possible interactions, allowing you to share messages, pictures, files and even up-to-the-minute information about what you are doing and where you are.
&lt;br&gt;
# Nothing new
These functions are not new or unique – any of these actions can also be performed via the internet without joining a social networking site.
&lt;br&gt;
# Potentially exposing
Although these networks can be very useful, and promote social interaction both online and offline, when using them you may be making information available to people who want to abuse it.
