Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To mimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
&lt;br&gt;
This assessment should identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
