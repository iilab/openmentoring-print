Your security and well being are always more important than a story. To minimise potential risks, it is important to prepare a security assessment before taking on a potentially dangerous story.
&lt;br&gt;
&gt; Step 1
# Identify known hazards

Identify contact people and the time and means of communication; describe all known hazards, including the history of problems in the reporting area; and outline contingency plans that address the perceived risks.
&lt;br&gt;
Consider the possibility that any circumstance — from a tense political situation to a natural disaster — can escalate in severity.
&lt;br&gt;
The assessment should include:
- where to stay and where to seek refuge if necessary
- where and how to get updated information inside the country
&lt;br&gt;
- whether equipment such as a weather-band or shortwave radio is needed
- whom to contact in the country, from local human rights groups to foreign embassies, for emergency information
&lt;br&gt;
 - travel plans and methods within the country
 - multiple entry and exit routes.
&lt;br&gt;

&gt; Step 2
# Address communications infrastructure

The assessment should address the communications infrastructure in the reporting area, identifying any contingency equipment you may need.
&lt;br&gt;
Are electricity, Internet access, and mobile and landline phone service available? Are they likely to remain so?
&lt;br&gt;
Is a generator or a car battery with a DC adaptor needed to power one’s computer? Should a satellite phone be used?
&lt;br&gt;
Basic needs such as nourishment and medical care must be addressed as well. Are food and water readily available? Is a hospital, clinic, or physician available? Is a medical kit needed, and what should it include?


&gt; Step 3
# Consult diverse sources

Consult diverse sources including journalists with experience in the location or topic, diplomatic advisories, reports on press freedom and human rights, and academic research.
&lt;br&gt;
Editors working with staffers or freelancers should have substantial input into the assessment, take the initiative in raising security questions, and receive a copy of the assessment.
&lt;br&gt;
An independent journalist working without a relationship with a news organization must be especially rigorous in compiling a security assessment, consulting with peers,[researching the risks](en/topics/practice-2-planning/0-getting-started/1-intro.md), and arranging a contact network.
