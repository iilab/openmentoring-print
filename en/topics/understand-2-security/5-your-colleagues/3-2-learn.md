## Sharing of information with your teams

It&#39;s important to think about what kinds of information you share with your colleagues and what information to keep private.
&lt;br&gt;
Sharing information with your colleagues about your sources and research means that they will be able to continue your important investigations should something unexpected arise.
&lt;br&gt;
On the other hand, sharing information only on a &#39;need to know&#39; basis means you might be better able to prevent infiltration by adversaries.
&lt;br&gt;
Whether you share much or little information with your colleagues, it is important that all information shared is done so securely.
&lt;br&gt;
Refer to the [Secure Communications](en/topics/understand-4-digisec/4-secure-communications/1-1-intro.md) and [Operational Security](en/topics/understand-3-opsec/0-getting-started/1-1-intro.md) lessons to learn how to do do so.
