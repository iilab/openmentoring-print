## Effects of traumatic stress

# Immediate numbness
At the time of a traumatic event, the person experiencing the event might feel numb and unable to respond.
&lt;br&gt;
# Shock
Immediately after a traumatic event, it is common for people to feel shocked, or dazed, or unable to process their own feelings.
&lt;br&gt;
# Other feelings
Over several hours or days, the feelings of shock and denial gradually fade, and other thoughts and feelings take their place.
&lt;br&gt;
# Trauma is strong
People react differently and take different amounts of time to come to terms with a traumatic event. Even so, you may be surprised by the strength of your feelings.
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Frightened* — that the same thing will happen again, or that you might lose control of your feelings and break down
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Helpless* - that something really bad happened and you could do nothing about it.
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Angry* — about what has happened and with whoever was responsible
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Guilty* — that you have survived when others have suffered or died
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Sad* - particularly if people were injured or killed, especially someone you knew.
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Ashamed or embarrassed* — that you have these strong feelings you can’t control, especially if you need others to support you
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Relieved* - that danger is over and that the danger has gone.
&lt;br&gt;
# Emotional
*Hopeful* - that your life will return to normal. People can start to feel more positive about things quite soon after a trauma.
&lt;br&gt;
# Physical
Strong feelings affect your physical health. In the weeks after a trauma, you may find that you:
&lt;br&gt;
- Cannot sleep
- Feel very tired
- Dream a lot and have nightmares
&lt;br&gt;
# Physical
- Have poor concentration
- Have memory problems
- Have difficulty thinking clearly
- Suffer from headaches
&lt;br&gt;
# Physical
- Experiences change in appetite
- Experiences changes in sex-drive or libido
- Have aches and pains
- Feel that your heart is beating faster.
&lt;br&gt;
# Physical
It may take weeks for some of these feelings and symptoms to pass. Remember that these are normal reactions to extreme circumstances. They are not signs that you are weak or sick.
