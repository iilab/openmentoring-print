## Build your emotional resilience

Any person whose work exposes them to many stories and pictures of traumatic events is at an increased risk of indirect exposure to traumatic stress.
&lt;br.
This includes psychologists, counselors, journalists, nurses, paramedics, as well as police officers and other emergency personnel.
&lt;br&gt;
The emotional risk is two-pronged: burnout and vicarious traumatization.
&lt;br&gt;
# Burnout
Burnout refers to long-term exhaustion caused by working too hard, for too long, and without sufficient support. It has been linked to a range of emotional and physical health problems, as well as poor performance in the workplace.
&lt;br&gt;
While exposure to threats or trauma is not a necessary feature of burnout, more emotionally demanding responsibilities place workers at greater risk.
&lt;br&gt;
The prevention of burnout requires a two-part strategy. The prevention of burnout is a shared responsibility between you and your employer.
&lt;br&gt;
1. Organizations must ensure a healthy work environment; appropriate levels of training, supervision, and support; reachable expectations and targets; as well as regular vacation time.
&lt;br&gt;
2. You should educate yourself of the risks of burnout, monitor your own emotional health, and actively sustain your own emotional health.
&lt;br&gt;
If you are suffering from burnout , the key to recovery is rest. It is essential that the you take time away from work to recover their emotional health.
&lt;br&gt;
During this period, it is important to examine and redesign the work situation that led to the problem in the first place. In addition, stress management training might help prevent future recurrence.

# Vicarious Traumatization
Vicarious traumatization refers to traumatic stress arising from exposure to the frightening experiences of others.
&lt;br&gt;
In most cases, vicarious traumatization shares the features of the [traumatic stress reaction](en/topics/understand-2-security/2-your-well-being/3-4-learn.md) relating to the stories that they have heard or the work they do.
&lt;br&gt;
In some cases, vicarious traumatization takes the form of a loss of faith in the essential goodness of others and a growing sense that oneâ€™s work is meaningless.
&lt;br&gt;
The prevention of vicarious traumatization requires limiting exposure to distressing stories or increasing the capacity to process traumatic material.
&lt;br&gt;
While the former may be difficult for many people due to the demands of their jobs, regular supervision and ongoing support is helpful for the latter.
&lt;br&gt;
 If you are suffering from vicarious traumatization, counseling is recommended. If you do not seek counseling, you might not make the most of your time off, resolve the vicarious trauma, or rest.
