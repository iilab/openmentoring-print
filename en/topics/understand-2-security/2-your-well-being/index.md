## Identifying traumata

# Trauma stress is common
Journalists and human rights defenders do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times.
&lt;br&gt;
# Recognise symptoms
It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress.
&lt;br&gt;
# Normal reaction to abnormal situation
Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal human experience can result in trauma. Such a response is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.
&lt;br&gt;
# How you respond
Trauma usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individualâ€™s coping mechanisms.
