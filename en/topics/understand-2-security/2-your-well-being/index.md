##What is post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma.
&lt;br&gt;
Certain factors such as if you or your family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or you donâ€™t receive much support from family or friends, can make you more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.
&lt;br&gt;
In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.
