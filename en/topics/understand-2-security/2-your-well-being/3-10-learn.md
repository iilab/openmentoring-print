## Dealing with post-traumatic stress

# Improving naturally
It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a few weeks.
&lt;br&gt;
# Visit a doctor
If you are still having problems for weeks after the traumatic experience, or if symptoms are particularly troublesome, you should visit a doctor.
&lt;br&gt;
# Mental health specialists
Your doctor may refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you would benefit from this treatment.
&lt;br&gt;
# PTSD is temporary
PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event.
&lt;br&gt;
# Treatment options
- Watchful waiting — waiting to see whether the symptoms improve without treatment
- Psychological treatment — such as psychotherapy or trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CPT)
- Antidepressant medication
