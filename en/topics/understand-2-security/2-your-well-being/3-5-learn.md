## Post-traumatic stress disorder

# Identifying PTSD
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma.
&lt;br&gt;
Certain factors can make you more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event. These include if you or your family have had depression or anxiety in the past, or if you don’t receive much support from family or friends.
&lt;br&gt;
In most cases, PTSD develops during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.

# Effects of PTSD
The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described in the following cards.
&lt;br&gt;
These symptoms are often severe and persistent and enough to have a significant impact on the person’s day-to-day life.
&lt;br&gt;
**Re-experiencing**
Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of flashbacks, nightmares or repetitive and distressing images or sensations.
&lt;br&gt;
This can even include physical sensations such s pain, sweating and trembling or negative thoughts about their experience.
&lt;br&gt;
**Avoidance**
Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD.
&lt;br&gt;
This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience. Many people with PTSD try distraction themselves with work or hobbies.
&lt;br&gt;
Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all, which can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn.
&lt;br&gt;
**Feeling on edge**
Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled.
&lt;br&gt;
This state of mind is known s hyper-arousal. Hyper-arousal often leads to irritability, angry outburst, sleeping problems (insomnia) and difficulty concentrating.
&lt;br&gt;
**Other problems**
- depression, anxiety and phobias
- drug misuse or alcohol misuse
- headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches
- PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.

# Dealing with PTSD
It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a few weeks.
&lt;br&gt;
If you are still having problems for weeks after the traumatic experience, or if symptoms are particularly troublesome, you should visit a doctor.
&lt;br&gt;
Your doctor may refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you would benefit from this treatment.
&lt;br&gt;
PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event.
&lt;br&gt;
**Treatment options**
- Watchful waiting — waiting to see whether the symptoms improve without treatment
- Psychological treatment — such as psychotherapy or trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CPT)
- Antidepressant medication
