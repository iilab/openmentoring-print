# Healthy levels of stress
With healthy levels of stress, symptoms are generally mild and temporary - people return to functioning when the stress factor is removed.
&lt;br&gt;
# Chronic stress
If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term however, symptoms can persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress.
&lt;br&gt;

Chronic stress occurs regularly among journalists and human rights defenders, yet often goes unrecognised or unreported.
&lt;br&gt;
